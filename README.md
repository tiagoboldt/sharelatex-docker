# sharelatex-docker

A docker image for running sharelatex. Still working, losely maintained, as ShareLaTex already has their own official image: https://hub.docker.com/r/sharelatex/sharelatex/
In contrast to the official repository this version runs in a single container.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tiagoboldt/sharelatex-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tiagoboldt/sharelatex-docker)

## Docker Image

To acquire the build image from the docker's repositories execute:

	docker pull  tiagoboldt/sharelatex-docker

## Dockerfile

To build the image from source execute:

	git clone https://github.com/tiagoboldt/sharelatex-docker.git
	cd sharelatex-docker
	docker build -t tiagoboldt/sharelatex-docker:sharelatex .

  Please keep in mind the building process will take up to 1 hour.

## Execution

To start the instance execute:

	mkdir /srv/sharelatex-data
	docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /srv/sharelatex-data:/data tiagoboldt/sharelatex-docker

It will be available on http://localhost:3000. Files will be kept in `/srv/sharelatex-data`. First execution might take some time to be ready. This is due to MongoDb pre-allocation.

## Create first user

    docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /srv/sharelatex-data:/data tiagoboldt/sharelatex-docker /bin/bash
    cd /sharelatex/web
    sharelatex.sh > /dev/null &
    # wait until sharelatex is available at http://localhost:3000
    grunt create-admin-user --email=joe@example.com
    # click the url and set your password
    # new users can be registred at http://localhost:3000/admin/register
